# Game Resources

Place your game assets in this directory:

## Sound Files
- `levelup.wav` - Sound played when leveling up
- `gameover.wav` - Sound played when the game ends
- `linecleared.wav` - Sound played when lines are cleared
- `highscorebeaten.wav` - Sound played when a new high score is achieved

## Image Files (optional)
You can add image files here for any future sprites or backgrounds.

## Notes
- Sound files should be in WAV format for best compatibility with pygame
- If sound files are missing, the game will run silently (no errors)
- All paths are relative to this resources directory
