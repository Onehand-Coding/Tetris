# Game Resources

Place your game assets in this directory:

## Sound Files
All sound files are located in the `sounds` subdirectory:
- `sounds/levelup.wav` - Sound played when leveling up
- `sounds/gameover.wav` - Sound played when the game ends
- `sounds/linecleared.wav` - Sound played when lines are cleared
- `sounds/highscorebeaten.wav` - Sound played when a new high score is achieved
- `sounds/background.wav` - Background music that loops continuously
- `sounds/clear.wav` - Sound played when lines are cleared
- `sounds/drop.wav` - Sound played when hard dropping a piece
- `sounds/lateralmove.wav` - Sound played when moving a piece left or right
- `sounds/rotate.wav` - Sound played when rotating a piece
- `sounds/select.wav` - Sound played when selecting menu options
- `sounds/start.wav` - Sound played when starting a new game
- `sounds/tetris.wav` - Sound played when clearing 4 lines at once

## Image Files (optional)
You can add image files here for any future sprites or backgrounds.

## Notes
- Sound files should be in WAV format for best compatibility with pygame
- If sound files are missing, the game will run silently (no errors)
- All paths are relative to this resources directory
